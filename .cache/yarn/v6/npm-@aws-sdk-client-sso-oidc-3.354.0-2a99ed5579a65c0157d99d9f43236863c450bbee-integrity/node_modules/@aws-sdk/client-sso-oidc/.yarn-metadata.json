The service also enables the client to\nfetch the user’s access token upon successful authentication and authorization with\nIAM Identity Center.</p>\n<note>\n<p>Although AWS Single Sign-On was renamed, the <code>sso</code> and\n<code>identitystore</code> API namespaces will continue to retain their original name for\nbackward compatibility purposes. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html#renamed\">IAM Identity Center rename</a>.</p>\n</note>\n<p>\n<b>Considerations for Using This Guide</b>\n</p>\n<p>Before you begin using this guide, we recommend that you first review the following\nimportant information about how the IAM Identity Center OIDC service works.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The IAM Identity Center OIDC service currently implements only the portions of the OAuth 2.0\nDevice Authorization Grant standard (<a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628\">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8628</a>) that are necessary to enable single\nsign-on authentication with the AWS CLI. Support for other OIDC flows frequently needed\nfor native applications, such as Authorization Code Flow (+ PKCE), will be addressed in\nfuture releases.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The service emits only OIDC access tokens, such that obtaining a new token (For\nexample, token refresh) requires explicit user re-authentication.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The access tokens provided by this service grant access to all AWS account\nentitlements assigned to an IAM Identity Center user, not just a particular application.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The documentation in this guide does not describe the mechanism to convert the access\ntoken into AWS Auth (“sigv4”) credentials for use with IAM-protected AWS service\nendpoints. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/PortalAPIReference/API_GetRoleCredentials.html\">GetRoleCredentials</a> in the <i>IAM Identity Center Portal API Reference\nGuide</i>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For general information about IAM Identity Center, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html\">What is\nIAM Identity Center?</a> in the <i>IAM Identity Center User Guide</i>.</p>\n\n## Installing\n\nTo install the this package, simply type add or install @aws-sdk/client-sso-oidc\nusing your favorite package manager:\n\n- `npm install @aws-sdk/client-sso-oidc`\n- `yarn add @aws-sdk/client-sso-oidc`\n- `pnpm add @aws-sdk/client-sso-oidc`\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Import\n\nThe AWS SDK is modulized by clients and commands.\nTo send a request, you only need to import the `SSOOIDCClient` and\nthe commands you need, for example `CreateTokenCommand`:\n\n```js\n// ES5 example\nconst { SSOOIDCClient, CreateTokenCommand } = require(\"@aws-sdk/client-sso-oidc\");\n```\n\n```ts\n// ES6+ example\nimport { SSOOIDCClient, CreateTokenCommand } from \"@aws-sdk/client-sso-oidc\";\n```\n\n### Usage\n\nTo send a request, you:\n\n- Initiate client with configuration (e.g. credentials, region).\n- Initiate command with input parameters.\n- Call `send` operation on client with command object as input.\n- If you are using a custom http handler, you may call `destroy()` to close open connections.\n\n```js\n// a client can be shared by different commands.\nconst client = new SSOOIDCClient({ region: \"REGION\" });\n\nconst params = {\n  /** input parameters */\n};\nconst command = new CreateTokenCommand(params);\n```\n\n#### Async/await\n\nWe recommend using [await](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)\noperator to wait for the promise returned by send operation as follows:\n\n```js\n// async/await.\ntry {\n  const data = await client.send(command);\n  // process data.\n} catch (error) {\n  // error handling.\n} finally {\n  // finally.\n}\n```\n\nAsync-await is clean, concise, intuitive, easy to debug and has better error handling\nas compared to using Promise chains or callbacks.\n\n#### Promises\n\nYou can also use [Promise chaining](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises#chaining)\nto execute send operation.\n\n```js\nclient.send(command).then(\n  (data) => {\n    // process data.\n  },\n  (error) => {\n    // error handling.\n  }\n);\n```\n\nPromises can also be called using `.catch()` and `.finally()` as follows:\n\n```js\nclient\n  .send(command)\n  .then((data) => {\n    // process data.\n  })\n  .catch((error) => {\n    // error handling.\n  })\n  .finally(() => {\n    // finally.\n  });\n```\n\n#### Callbacks\n\nWe do not recommend using callbacks because of [callback hell](http://callbackhell.com/),\nbut they are supported by the send operation.\n\n```js\n// callbacks.\nclient.send(command, (err, data) => {\n  // process err and data.\n});\n```\n\n#### v2 compatible style\n\nThe client can also send requests using v2 compatible style.\nHowever, it results in a bigger bundle size and may be dropped in next major version. More details in the blog post\non [modular packages in AWS SDK for JavaScript](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/modular-packages-in-aws-sdk-for-javascript/)\n\n```ts\nimport * as AWS from \"@aws-sdk/client-sso-oidc\";\nconst client = new AWS.SSOOIDC({ region: \"REGION\" });\n\n// async/await.\ntry {\n  const data = await client.createToken(params);\n  // process data.\n} catch (error) {\n  // error handling.\n}\n\n// Promises.\nclient\n  .createToken(params)\n  .then((data) => {\n    // process data.\n  })\n  .catch((error) => {\n    // error handling.\n  });\n\n// callbacks.\nclient.createToken(params, (err, data) => {\n  // process err and data.\n});\n```\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nWhen the service returns an exception, the error will include the exception information,\nas well as response metadata (e.g. request id).\n\n```js\ntry {\n  const data = await client.send(command);\n  // process data.\n} catch (error) {\n  const { requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId } = error.$$metadata;\n  console.log({ requestId, cfId, extendedRequestId });\n  /**\n   * The keys within exceptions are also parsed.\n   * You can access them by specifying exception names:\n   * if (error.name === 'SomeServiceException') {\n   *     const value = error.specialKeyInException;\n   * }\n   */\n}\n```\n\n## Getting Help\n\nPlease use these community resources for getting help.\nWe use the GitHub issues for tracking bugs and feature requests, but have limited bandwidth to address them.\n\n- Visit [Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v3/developer-guide/welcome.html)\n  or [API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/v3/latest/index.html).\n- Check out the blog posts tagged with [`aws-sdk-js`](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/tag/aws-sdk-js/)\n  on AWS Developer Blog.\n- Ask a question on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/aws-sdk-js) and tag it with `aws-sdk-js`.\n- Join the AWS JavaScript community on [gitter](https://gitter.im/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3).\n- If it turns out that you may have found a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/issues/new/choose).\n\nTo test your universal JavaScript code in Node.js, browser and react-native environments,\nvisit our [code samples repo](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-sdk-js-tests).\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis client code is generated automatically.
