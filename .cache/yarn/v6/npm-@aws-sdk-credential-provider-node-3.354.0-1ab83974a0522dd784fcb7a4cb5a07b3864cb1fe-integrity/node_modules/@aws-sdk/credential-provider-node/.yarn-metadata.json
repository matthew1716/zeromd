It will attempt to find credentials\nfrom the following sources (listed in order of precedence):\n\n- Environment variables exposed via `process.env`\n- SSO credentials from token cache\n- Web identity token credentials\n- Shared credentials and config ini files\n- The EC2/ECS Instance Metadata Service\n\nThe default credential provider will invoke one provider at a time and only\ncontinue to the next if no credentials have been located. For example, if the\nprocess finds values defined via the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and\n`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables, the files at `~/.aws/credentials`\nand `~/.aws/config` will not be read, nor will any messages be sent to the\nInstance Metadata Service.\n\nIf invalid configuration is encountered (such as a profile in\n`~/.aws/credentials` specifying as its `source_profile` the name of a profile\nthat does not exist), then the chained provider will be rejected with an error\nand will not invoke the next provider in the list.\n\n_IMPORTANT_: if you intend to acquire credentials using EKS \n[IAM Roles for Service Accounts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) \nthen you must explicitly specify a value for `roleAssumerWithWebIdentity`. There is a\ndefault function available in `@aws-sdk/client-sts` package. An example of using\nthis:\n\n```js\nconst { getDefaultRoleAssumerWithWebIdentity } = require(\"@aws-sdk/client-sts\");\nconst { defaultProvider } = require(\"@aws-sdk/credential-provider-node\");\nconst { S3Client, GetObjectCommand } = require(\"@aws-sdk/client-s3\");\n\nconst provider = defaultProvider({\n  roleAssumerWithWebIdentity: getDefaultRoleAssumerWithWebIdentity(),\n});\n\nconst client = new S3Client({ credentialDefaultProvider: provider });\n```\n\n_IMPORTANT_: We provide a wrapper of this provider in `@aws-sdk/credential-providers`\npackage to save you from importing `getDefaultRoleAssumerWithWebIdentity()` or\n`getDefaultRoleAssume()` from STS package. Similarly, you can do:\n\n```js\nconst { fromNodeProviderChain } = require(\"@aws-sdk/credential-providers\");\n\nconst credentials = fromNodeProviderChain();\n\nconst client = new S3Client({ credentials });\n```\n\n## Supported configuration\n\nYou may customize how credentials are resolved by providing an options hash to\nthe `defaultProvider` factory function. The following options are\nsupported:\n\n- `profile` - The configuration profile to use. If not specified, the provider\n  will use the value in the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable or a default of\n  `default`.\n- `filepath` - The path to the shared credentials file. If not specified, the\n  provider will use the value in the `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` environment\n  variable or a default of `~/.aws/credentials`.\n- `configFilepath` - The path to the shared config file. If not specified, the\n  provider will use the value in the `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable or a\n  default of `~/.aws/config`.\n- `mfaCodeProvider` - A function that returns a a promise fulfilled with an\n  MFA token code for the provided MFA Serial code. If a profile requires an MFA\n  code and `mfaCodeProvider` is not a valid function, the credential provider\n  promise will be rejected.\n- `roleAssumer` - A function that assumes a role and returns a promise\n  fulfilled with credentials for the assumed role. If not specified, the SDK\n  will create an STS client and call its `assumeRole` method.\n- `roleArn` - ARN to assume. If not specified, the provider will use the value\n  in the `AWS_ROLE_ARN` environment variable.\n- `webIdentityTokenFile` - File location of where the `OIDC` token is stored.\n  If not specified, the provider will use the value in the `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE`\n  environment variable.\n- `roleAssumerWithWebIdentity` - A function that assumes a role with web identity and\n  returns a promise fulfilled with credentials for the assumed role.\n- `timeout` - The connection timeout (in milliseconds) to apply to any remote\n  requests. If not specified, a default value of `1000` (one second) is used.\n- `maxRetries` - The maximum number of times any HTTP connections should be\n  retried. If not specified, a default value of `0` will be used.\n\n## Related packages:\n\n- [AWS Credential Provider for Node.JS - Environment Variables](../credential-provider-env)\n- [AWS Credential Provider for Node.JS - SSO](../credential-provider-sso)\n- [AWS Credential Provider for Node.JS - Web Identity](../credential-provider-web-identity)\n- [AWS Credential Provider for Node.JS - Shared Configuration Files](../credential-provider-ini)\n- [AWS Credential Provider for Node.JS - Instance and Container Metadata](../credential-provider-imds)\n- [AWS Shared Configuration File Loader](../shared-ini-file-loader)\n",
