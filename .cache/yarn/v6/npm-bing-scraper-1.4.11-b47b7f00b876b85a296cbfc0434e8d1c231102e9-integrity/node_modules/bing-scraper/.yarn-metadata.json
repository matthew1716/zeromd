If it isn't an object, the code attempts to make it a string.\n\n``cb`` is also required and is used as a callback.\n\n#### ``query`` object variables\n\n```js\n{\n    \"q\": \"hello world\",\n    \"userAgent\": \"browser's user agent\",\n    \"lang\": \"browser's Accept-Language header\",\n    \"enforceLanguage\": false,\n    \"referer\": \"browser's referer\",\n    \"pageCount\": 1\n}\n```\n\n``q`` or ``url`` is required in the object.\n\n``q`` is the query of your search, ``url`` is a URL you recieve from either the ``prevHref``, ``currHref`` or ``nextHref`` varibles in the response.\n\n``userAgent`` is the User Agent used to request Bing with. If it is not set, it defaults to ``Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:87.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/87.0``.\n\n``lang`` is the ``Accept-Language`` header used. If it is not set, it defaults to ``en-US,en;q=0.5``.\n\n``enforceLanguage`` is what determines the result's language, a ``lang`` is reccomended but not required. This correlates *with* the ``lang`` object. This variable must be either ``true`` or ``false`` and defaults to ``false``.\n\n``referer`` is the ``Referer`` header used to request Bing with. If it isn't set it defaults to ``https://www.bing.com/``.\n\n``pageCount`` is the number of pages the scraper pulls. This variable must be an Interger and defaults to ``1``.\n\n#### result\n\n*Shortened for readability purposes.*\n\n```js\n{\n  {\n   \"currHref\": \"https://www.bing.com/search?q=idkhow%20members&search=&lf=1&form=QBLH\",\n   \"results\": [\n      {\n         \"title\": \"I Dont Know How But They Found Me - Wikipedia\",\n         \"url\": \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Don%27t_Know_How_But_They_Found_Me#:~:text=%28Redirected%20from%20I%20Don%27t%20Know%20How%20But%20They,and%20bassist%20Dallon%20Weekes%20and%20drummer%20Ryan%20Seaman.\",\n         \"description\": \"Hey, _srchprty_ I've been looking into iDKHOW and Tellexx.
