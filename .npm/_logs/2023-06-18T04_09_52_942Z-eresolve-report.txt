# npm resolution error report

While resolving: baileys-md@5.0.5
Found: jimp@0.22.8
node_modules/jimp
  jimp@"^0.22.7" from the root project

Could not resolve dependency:
peerOptional jimp@"^0.16.1" from @adiwajshing/baileys@5.0.5
node_modules/@adiwajshing/baileys
  @adiwajshing/baileys@"npm:baileys-md@^5.0.5" from the root project

Conflicting peer dependency: jimp@0.16.13
node_modules/jimp
  peerOptional jimp@"^0.16.1" from @adiwajshing/baileys@5.0.5
  node_modules/@adiwajshing/baileys
    @adiwajshing/baileys@"npm:baileys-md@^5.0.5" from the root project

Fix the upstream dependency conflict, or retry
this command with --force or --legacy-peer-deps
to accept an incorrect (and potentially broken) dependency resolution.
